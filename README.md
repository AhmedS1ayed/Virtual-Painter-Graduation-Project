# Computer-Vision 
## Virtual Painter Js
## Main Branch
The Main has the files modified while integrating with the front end.

## Demo Branch 
The Demo has the Demo Module Created Before integrating with the front end (it was lacking some features that have been add later).

## PythonFlask Branch 
initially it was supposed to be a python project that works on the server but we find out that working on js is much more optimized as the processing happens in the browser (user-side) instead of server-side so this branch has a deprecated version from our project.
