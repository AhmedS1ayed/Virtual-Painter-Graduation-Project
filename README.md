# Description 
 This is a virtual painter package which is a tool provided to social media platform project that was made for artists.
## How to run
### - run server in the cloned folder and then open gaugan.html
python -m http.server 8000
## Virtual Painter Js
Draw using camera with the support of keyboard (using space button) to determine when to start drawing and when to stop.
### Note : 
You can use config to configure the image processing tool into capturing the pen you are drawing with.
## Main Branch
The Main has the files modified while integrating with the front end.

## Demo Branch 
The Demo has the Demo Module Created Before integrating with the front end (it was lacking some features that have been add later).

## PythonFlask Branch 
initially it was supposed to be a python project that works on the server but we find out that working on js is much more optimized as the processing happens in the browser (user-side) instead of server-side so this branch has a deprecated version from the project.
